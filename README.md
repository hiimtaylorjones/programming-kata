# Coding Katas

If you're not aware about [Coding Katas](http://codekata.com/) they're essentially
popular exercises in coding that were popularized by folks who have been pretty
active in the Ruby community.

A few friends have told me to try giving them a shot, so this repo contains a
few attempts at it. Most solutions are initially in Ruby. However, I'm working
on expanding it out to other languages.
